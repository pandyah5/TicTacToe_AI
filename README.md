# TicTacToe_AI
The repository contains the code for TicTacToe game with two modes 'Human Vs Human' and 'AI Vs Human'. The sad part is that you can never win against the AI, don't believe me try it out !!!

# Algorithm
The AI uses MiniMax algorithm that stimulates the possible game tree at a given board stage and chooses the best possible move. Due to the deterministic nature of tic tac toe and small game space, the AI cannot be defeated, however a perfect game play can result in a tie.

Future Updates: Alpha Beta prunning will be added to improve the speed of the AI

# Game Play
There are two modes 'Human Vs Human' for multiplayer and 'AI vs Human' for single players. There is also an optional choice for 'hints' in the multiplayer mode, where the player recieves hints from the AI. By default the number of hints are limited to two.

# Upcoming Updates
To improve the GUI, pygame will be used to make it more interactive.
